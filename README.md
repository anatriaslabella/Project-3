Instructions for running our code:
1. Download the "titles.basics.tsv.gz" and "title.ratings.tsv.gz" from https://datasets.imdbws.com/ and extract the elements. These two files consist of our database. Make sure that these are included where files are read with stream (eg. cmake-build-debug for CLion).
2. Download our main.cpp and Merge.cpp files. Merge.cpp includes our code to filter the entire "titles.basics.tsv" file to only show titles of titleType movie and tvSeries. This is saved into a new file that should go to your cmake-build-debug folder. It then merges the "title.ratings.tsv" file with the new filtered file and creates the final file as a merged data file. This will be used in our main program.
3. Make sure the merged data file is in the cmake-build-debug folder. Then you should be able to simply run the program, as it reads from the exact merged data tsv file.
